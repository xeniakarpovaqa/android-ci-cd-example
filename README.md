# 📱 Android CI/CD GitHub Actions Demo

This repository contains the implementation of a test task for setting up a **CI/CD workflow** for an Android project using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## 📋 Task Description

Configure GitHub Actions so that on every push to the `main` branch:

- 🛠️ A release APK is built  
- 🚀 A new GitHub Release is created automatically  
- 📦 The generated APK is uploaded to that release  

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Trigger workflow on `push` to `main`
- Set up **Java** and **Android SDK**
- Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` to build APK
- Generate version and APK name using either:
  - `versionName` and `versionCode` from `build.gradle`
  - or **date and commit hash**
- Use `actions/create-release` and `actions/upload-release-asset` to publish APK

---

## ✨ Optional

- Extract `versionName` from `build.gradle`
- Generate a **changelog** using `git log`

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

- ✅ CI/CD workflow runs on every push to `main`  
- ✅ Generates a versioned tag using **date** and **commit hash**  
- ✅ Creates a GitHub Release with autogenerated tag  
- ✅ Uploads APK (dummy file in this case) to the release  
- ✅ Generates a `CHANGELOG.md` file using recent commit messages (`git log`)  
- ✅ Also uploads the changelog to the GitHub Release  

---

⚠️ **Note:** For demonstration purposes, the build step currently uses a **dummy APK file** instead of executing `./gradlew assembleRelease`. Replacing it with an actual project build is straightforward.
