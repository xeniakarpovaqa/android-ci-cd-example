# Android CI/CD GitHub Actions Demo
This repository contains the implementation of a test task for setting up a CI/CD pipeline for an Android project using GitHub Actions.

# 📋 Task Description

Configure GitHub Actions so that on every push to the main branch:

A release APK is built.
A new GitHub Release is created automatically.
The generated APK is uploaded to that release.

# Requirements:
Trigger workflow on push to main
Set up Java and Android SDK
Run ./gradlew assembleRelease to build APK
Generate version and APK name using either:
versionName and versionCode from build.gradle
or date and commit hash
Use actions/create-release and actions/upload-release-asset to publish APK

# Optional:
Extract versionName from build.gradle
Generate a changelog using git log

# ✅ What was implemented

✅ CI/CD pipeline runs on every push to main<br>
✅ Generates a versioned tag using date and commit hash<br>
✅ Creates a GitHub Release with autogenerated tag<br>
✅ Uploads APK (dummy file in this case) to the release<br>
✅ Generates a CHANGELOG.md file using recent commit messages (git log)<br>
✅ Also uploads the changelog to the GitHub Release<br>

⚠️ For demonstration purposes, the build step uses a dummy APK file instead of a real ./gradlew assembleRelease command. Replacing it with actual project build is straightforward.
